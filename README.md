# Polo Atacado

This repository is dedicated to preserving and showcasing a historical snapshot of a website I developed in 2013 while working at "Commquest Comunicação." The original website was for **Polo Atacado**, a company that has been inactive for several years, leading to the website’s eventual discontinuation.

## How to publish?

```
npm run deploy
```

## Purpose

The primary motivation behind this project is nostalgia and historical preservation. By restoring the site, I aim to keep a digital record of a project I developed during my professional journey.

## Restoration Process

Given the absence of the original source files, I reconstructed the website using resources recovered from the Wayback Machine. To reassemble its components, I employed **Jigsaw**, a PHP-based static site generator (SSG). The generated static files are published through GitHub Pages for public viewing.
